Oblig 2 introduction to AI

We chose task 1. 

First we looked at if we needed to use regression or classification algorithm. We found that it is a regression problem, becuase the target variable is continous and that fits for regression algorithms. Classification alghoritms are used more for categories, like the example of the computer using pixels to see if its a banana or orange.
